The prefabs in this folder are intended to be used as stand alone models. they are scaled to unity 
dimensions and are at least 2 unity units big.



If you want to use the derelict ships and parts together with my other spaceships like "Berlin Class Battlecruiser" or
"Hindenburg Class Battleship" you should use the prefabs in the folder: 

					"Prefabs"

The prefabs in the above mentioned folder are scaled smaller so that the derelict ships and parts are
in relation to the capital ships.
