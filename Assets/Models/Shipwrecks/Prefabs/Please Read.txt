The prefabs in this folder are intended to be used with my other spaceships, e.g. Berlin Class 
Battlecruiser or Hindenburg Class Battleship.

These capital ships are ca. 2 unity unit big. The prefabs of the derelict ships and parts are 
therefore smaller than two unity units.

If you want to use the derelict ships and parts separately you should use the prefabs in the folder: 

			"PrefabsUnityDimensions"

The prefabs in the above mentioned folder are scaled bigger so that the derelict ships and parts are 2 unity 
units big.
